# NWD_DevsNewMonthChallenge_November

Write a function in JavaScript and/or PHP that takes a text string and converts all the @names in the string into a link representation of that name, just like the way facebook does mentions. 

Eg: I have a string:
Like: "Hello @name1 how is @name2 I do hope @name3 is still coding"; 

Function should convert @name1 @name2 &amp;&amp; @name3 to links.  
Like: &lt;a href="#" title="name1">name1&lt;/a> etc...
